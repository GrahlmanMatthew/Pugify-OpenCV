# Pugify
## What is Pugify?
Pugify is a simple camera-filter application that uses facial recognition to overlay Pug faces ontop of people's faces given a live camera feed, such as a webcam. This absurd but humorous camera-filter was built using OpenCV, a popular Computer Vision Python library that makes facial detection a cakewalk.

## Execution
- Install Pugify's dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run Pugify using `python main.py`.

## Sample Execution
The following GIF is a live-demo of the Pugify camera-filter.
