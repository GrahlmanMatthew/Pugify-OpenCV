# Pugify
## What is Pugify?
Pugify is a simple camera-filter application that identifies faces from a live camera feed and if any are detected then it will overlay an image of a Pug's face ontop of theirs. This absurd but humorous camera-filter was built using OpenCV, a popular Computer Vision Python library that makes facial detection a cakewalk.

## Execution
- Install Pugify's dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run Pugify using `python main.py`.

## Sample Execution
The following GIF is a live-demo of the Pugify camera-filter.
